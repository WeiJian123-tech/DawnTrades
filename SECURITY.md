## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

Please report vulnerabilities to "Issues" tab with a detailed description of what you encountered,
how did it happen, why is it important to fix, when did you encounter these vulnerabilities,
and any possible solutions that may be able to resolve such vulnerabilities? 

While we may not have a defined schedule, we will get back to your request as soon as possible with
a reply, global message, or a software update in the future.

Your report may be accepted or declined depending on the severity of the vulnerability, if you clearly filled 
all requirements for the report, if the vulnerability was recognized before or fixed before,
and our expertise/ability in solving this vulnerability.

If your report has recognized, please do not post or repost the same report again under "Issues" tab.
