# Project-GoldenTrades

Project GoldenTrades is a stock charting Java program that is intended to assist with trading publicly available common stock.

Java and the Java Library xChart is utilized for the creation of this program due to the relative ease and convienence of making fast programs with graphs/charts.

Please make sure that you have version Java 8 or higher and the latest xChart update to be able to run this program effectively.

Currently, the development of this working prototype does not have all the features that are going to be present in the final non-prototype build. All features, User Interfaces (U.I.), and methodologies are subject to change during development and improvements of this and future working prototypes. What this working prototype is supposed to have is:

* A simple static graph that shows the stock price of a single stock ticker that has slight prediction capabilities.

* Stock price prediction(s) that are calculated by our program's algorithm and displayed using some kind of indicator for where the stock price is going to be at. 

* Using Technical Analysis for the program's algorithm. Combining it with Fundamental Analysis could be in our next working prototype.

* Inserting stock data via .csv file.

For long time goals:

* Get stock data from `.csv` files.

* Be able to predict time to buy and sell for 1 day, 5 days, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, 10 years, and lifetime of stock.

* Clean, simple, easy to understand User Interface (U.I.)

* Fast - Trades today happen between milliseconds to nanoseconds. Should speed be balanced by accuracy or should speed be prioritized over accuracy?

Extra features that could be added:

* Screenshots of graphs

* Customizations of U.I. or trading strategies.

Currently only able to run via IDE and downloading files.
