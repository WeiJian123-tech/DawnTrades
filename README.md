**About**

DawnTrades is a free and open source stock charting Java program that is intended to assist with trading publicly available common stock.

Java and the Java Library [XChart](https://github.com/knowm/XChart.git) is utilized for the creation of DawnTrades due to the relative ease and convenience of making fast programs with graphs/charts.

Please make sure that you have version Java 8 or higher and the latest xChart update to be able to run this program effectively.
Best compatible with Windows Operating Systems (O.S.). Untested for Mac and Linux O.S. Incompatable with mobile devices.

Currently, the development of this working prototype does not have all the features that are going to be present in the final non-prototype build. All features, User Interfaces (U.I.), and methodologies are subject to change during the development and improvement of this and future working prototypes. DawnTrades currently has:

* A simple static graph that shows the stock price of a single stock ticker.
  
* Inserting stock data via .csv file.

* Stock indicators.

* Technical Analysis integration.

For long time goals:

* Using Funadamental Analysis combined with Technical Analysis to provide accurate predictions that can be displayed on charts.

* Be able to predict time to buy and sell for 1 day, 5 days, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, 10 years, and lifetime of stock.

* Clean, simple, easy to understand User Interface (U.I.)

* Fast - Trades today happen between milliseconds to nanoseconds.
  - Should speed be balanced by accuracy, or should speed be prioritized over accuracy?

Extra features that could be added:

* Customizations of U.I.
* Customization of trading strategies.

As of right now, people can only be able to access DawnTrades by downloading the zip file provided by Github and running it through a Java IDE. A runnable `.jar` file may be developed for this working prototype or the next version of this working prototype.
