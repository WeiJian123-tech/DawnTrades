# Project-GoldenTrades

Project GoldenTrades is a Java program that is intended to trade stocks automatically. 

Java and the Java Library xChart is utilized for the creation of this program due to the relative ease and convienence of making fast programs with graphs/charts.

Currently however, the development of this working prototype does not have all the features for a automatic trading algorithm. What this working prototype is supposed to have is:

* Graphs that shows stock price: first and foremost static graphs to test the programs prediction capabilities and model the stock market during the weekends. Afterwards real-time non-static graphs that display the stock price as it fluctuates during trading hours.

* Stock price predictions that are calculated by our program's algorithm and displayed using some kind of indicator for where the stock price is going to be at. 

* Using Technical Analysis for the program's algorithm. Combining it with Fundamental Analysis could be in our next working prototype.

* Inserting stock data via arrays, lists, user input, or .txt file.

For long time goals:

* Get real time stock data from the internet
  - If not, be able to input data manually.

* Be able to predict time to buy and sell for 1 day, 5 days, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, 10 years, and lifetime of stock.

* Clean, simple, easy to understand User Interface (U.I.)

* Fast - many other stock trading programs trade in milliseconds to nanoseconds.

Extra features that could be added:

* Screenshots of graphs

* Customizations of U.I. or trading strategies.

Currently only able to run via IDE and downloading files.
